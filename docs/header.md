# Datavized Code Style

Our code style is based on Crockford's, with a few modifications.

## The Basics
- Indent with tabs, not spaces
- Always end statements with semicolons
- Conditionals and loops ("if", "while", "for") always use curly braces
- Never use `var`. Use `const` wherever possible and `let` only if necessary.
- Always use "strict equal" (`===` and `!==`, not `==` or `!=`)
- Define variables in scope, never global.
